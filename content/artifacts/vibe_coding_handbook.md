A practical guide to rapidly prototype ideas using AI-powered development tools, following software engineering best practices.

## Introduction to Vibe Coding

Vibe coding is a revolutionary approach to software development where you describe your application requirements in natural language, and AI tools generate the code for you. Coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, vibe coding represents a paradigm shift where developers describe software requirements in natural language and trust AI to handle implementation details.

This approach enables Product Owners and non-technical users to rapidly prototype and build functional applications without traditional coding knowledge. 25% of Y Combinator's Winter 2025 startups building 95% of their codebase with AI assistance, demonstrating the real-world viability of this approach.

### Key Benefits

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Build working applications in hours instead of weeks
- **No Coding Required**: Describe functionality in plain English
- **Cost Effective**: Reduce development costs for MVPs and prototypes
- **Quick Iteration**: Make changes through simple text instructions

### When to Use Vibe Coding

Vibe coding is ideal for:
- Building MVPs and prototypes
- Creating proof-of-concept applications
- Testing business ideas quickly
- Developing internal tools and dashboards

## Essential Tools

This guide uses specific, tested tools that work best together for rapid prototyping:

### Primary Development Platform
- **Bolt.new**: Your main development tool. Creates working prototypes in 15 seconds, handles full-stack applications, integrates with GitHub for version control, and supports deployment to Netlify.

### Quality Assurance Tools
- **Google Lighthouse**: Built into Chrome browser for performance testing
- **OWASP ZAP**: Free security testing (download from zaproxy.org)
- **WAVE Web Accessibility Checker**: Browser extension for accessibility testing
- **Netlify**: Deployment platform (free tier, integrates directly with Bolt.new)

## The Vibe Coding Workflow

This workflow integrates all essential software development lifecycle (SDLC) phases while maintaining simplicity for non-technical users.

```
Planning → Design → Development → Testing → Deployment → User Acceptance → Maintenance
```

Each phase includes security, accessibility, and performance considerations from the start.

## Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Phase 1: Planning and Requirements

**Objective**: Create a Product Requirements Document (PRD) that will guide all subsequent phases.

**What You'll Create**: A detailed PRD document generated from your high-level app idea.

**Step-by-Step Process**:

#### 1.1 Gather Your Basic App Idea
Think about these simple questions (don't overthink - just basic answers):
- What problem does your app solve?
- Who will use it?
- What are the 3-5 main things users should be able to do?
- Is it a web app, mobile app, or both?

#### 1.2 Generate Your PRD Using AI
1. Open ChatGPT, Claude, or Bolt.new
2. Use this prompt with your basic information:

**PRD Generation Prompt (Copy and Customize)**:
```
I need you to create a comprehensive Product Requirements Document (PRD) for my app idea. Here's my basic information:

MY APP IDEA:
- App Name: [Your app name or "TBD"]
- Problem it solves: [Brief description - e.g., "Small business owners can't track tasks efficiently"]
- Target users: [Who will use it - e.g., "Small business owners with 1-10 employees"]
- Main features I want: [List 3-5 basic features - e.g., "Add tasks, see task list, mark tasks complete, set priorities"]
- Platform: [Web app, mobile app, or both]
- Rough user count: [How many people might use it - e.g., "50-100 users"]

Create a detailed PRD with this exact structure:

========================================
PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT  
========================================

PROJECT NAME: [Generate from my app idea]
PURPOSE: [Expand my problem description into clear business purpose]
TARGET USERS: [Expand my target users with specific characteristics and needs]

========================================
CORE FEATURES (Must-Have)
========================================

[For each of my main features, create detailed sections with:]
FEATURE [X]: [Feature name]
DESCRIPTION: [Detailed explanation of functionality]
USER VALUE: [Why users need this feature]
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA: [4-6 specific, testable requirements that define when this feature is complete]

========================================
USER FLOWS
========================================

PRIMARY FLOW: [Create main user journey from start to finish]
SECONDARY FLOW: [Create second most important user journey]

========================================
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
========================================

PLATFORM: [Based on my preference]
PERFORMANCE: [Specific targets for load time, responsiveness]
SECURITY: [Data security requirements appropriate for my app]
ACCESSIBILITY: [WCAG compliance requirements]
USERS: [Concurrent user support based on my estimate]

========================================
DATA REQUIREMENTS
========================================

DATA TO STORE: [List specific data types with character limits]
STORAGE METHOD: [Recommend appropriate storage for my app complexity]
INTEGRATIONS: [Suggest any needed integrations based on my features]

Make sure every section is complete and specific enough to guide development phases.
```

#### 1.3 Review and Refine Your Generated PRD
1. Read through the generated PRD
2. Check if it captures your vision accurately
3. If something doesn't match your intent, use this refinement prompt:

**PRD Refinement Prompt**:
```
Review this PRD you created for my app. I need to adjust these parts:

[Paste the sections you want to change]

Changes needed:
- [Specific changes - e.g., "Feature 2 should focus on X instead of Y"]
- [Additional requirements - e.g., "Add integration with email"]
- [Corrections - e.g., "Target users should be X not Y"]

Please update only these sections while keeping the rest of the PRD intact.
```

#### 1.4 Save Your Final PRD
1. Copy the final PRD into a text document
2. Save it as "PRD-[YourAppName].txt" or Google Doc
3. This document will be referenced in every subsequent phase

**Example of High-Level Input → Generated PRD**:

**Your Input**:
```
- App Name: TaskFlow Pro
- Problem: Small business owners forget tasks and miss deadlines
- Target users: Small business owners with 1-10 employees  
- Main features: Add tasks, task dashboard, mark complete, set priorities, simple reports
- Platform: Web app
- User count: 50-100 users
```

**Generated PRD** (AI would create the complete detailed version):
```
========================================
PRODUCT REQUIREMENTS DOCUMENT
========================================

PROJECT NAME: TaskFlow Pro
PURPOSE: Help small business owners efficiently track and manage daily tasks to prevent missed deadlines and improve productivity
TARGET USERS: Small business owners with 1-10 employees who currently rely on scattered notes, mental tracking, or basic tools that don't provide adequate task organization and priority management

========================================
CORE FEATURES (Must-Have)
========================================

FEATURE 1: Task Creation and Management
DESCRIPTION: Users can create, edit, and delete tasks with comprehensive details including due dates, priority levels, and descriptions
USER VALUE: Replaces unreliable mental tracking and scattered notes with a centralized, organized task management system
ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA:
- Users can create new tasks with title (max 100 characters), description (max 500 characters), due date, and priority level
- Users can edit all task details after creation
- Users can delete tasks with confirmation prompt
- System validates required fields and shows appropriate error messages
- Task creation form is accessible via prominent "Add Task" button
- All task operations work smoothly on both desktop and mobile

[AI would continue with detailed sections for all features, user flows, technical requirements, etc.]
```

**✅ DELIVERABLE**: Complete, detailed PRD document ready for Phase 2, generated from your simple app idea in 10-15 minutes instead of hours.

### Phase 2: Design and User Experience

**Objective**: Create visual wireframes and user interface design using your completed PRD.

**What You'll Use**: 
- Your completed PRD document from Phase 1 (have it open)
- Bolt.new for creating the design

**Step-by-Step Process**:
1. Open Bolt.new in your browser (bolt.new)
2. Start a new project
3. Copy your entire PRD and use this prompt:

**Design Prompt (Copy and Customize)**:
```
I need to create wireframes and visual design for this application. Here is my complete PRD:

[PASTE YOUR ENTIRE COMPLETED PRD HERE - ALL SECTIONS]

Based on this PRD, create wireframes with:

HOMEPAGE/DASHBOARD DESIGN:
- Header with app name "[Your Project Name from PRD]"
- "Add Task" button prominently displayed
- Task display area organized by: [reference your user flows from PRD]
- Show task priority using: [colors mentioned in your PRD acceptance criteria]
- Mobile-responsive layout that works on phones

TASK CREATION FORM:
- Fields for: [list exactly what's in your PRD data requirements]
- Form validation and error messaging
- Save and Cancel buttons
- Modal or sidebar layout for mobile

VISUAL STYLE:
- Professional and clean design suitable for [your target users from PRD]
- Color scheme: Primary blue (#2563eb), secondary gray (#6b7280), accent green (#10b981)
- Typography: Clear, readable fonts
- High contrast for accessibility

RESPONSIVE REQUIREMENTS:
- Mobile-first design (works on phones first)
- Touch-friendly buttons (minimum 44px)
- Readable text on small screens

Create the complete HTML structure with CSS styling that I can preview immediately.
```

**What You'll Get**: Working HTML/CSS wireframes showing your complete application interface

#### 2.1 Refining Your Wireframes
If the first design doesn't match your vision, refine it using these steps:

**Step 1: Identify Specific Changes**
Look at the generated wireframes and note exactly what needs to change:
- Layout issues (positioning, spacing, size)
- Visual problems (colors, fonts, styling)
- Missing elements from your PRD
- Mobile responsiveness issues

**Step 2: Use Targeted Refinement Prompts**
Continue in the same Bolt.new project (don't start new) and use specific prompts:

**For Layout Changes**:
```
I need to adjust the layout of my wireframes:

SPECIFIC CHANGES NEEDED:
- [Element name] should be positioned [where] instead of [current position]
- [Section name] needs more/less spacing
- [Button/form] should be larger/smaller for better mobile use

Keep all other design elements the same, just fix these layout issues.
```

**For Visual Style Changes**:
```
I need to update the visual styling:

STYLE CHANGES:
- Change color scheme to: [specific colors]
- Update typography to: [font preferences]
- Modify [specific element] to look more [professional/modern/friendly]

Maintain the same layout and functionality, just update the visual appearance.
```

**For Missing Features**:
```
I noticed these elements from my PRD are missing from the wireframes:

MISSING ELEMENTS:
- [Feature name from PRD]: [specific description of what's missing]
- [UI element]: [where it should appear and how it should look]

Please add these elements while keeping all existing design intact.
```

**Step 3: Test Responsiveness**
After each refinement, test the wireframes on different screen sizes:
1. In Bolt.new, click the mobile/tablet view buttons
2. Check if all elements are readable and clickable
3. If issues found, use this prompt:

```
The mobile version has these issues:
- [Specific mobile problems - text too small, buttons too close, etc.]
- [Elements that don't fit properly on small screens]

Please fix these mobile responsiveness issues while keeping desktop version intact.
```

**Step 4: Final Design Validation**
Before moving to Phase 3, ensure your wireframes include:
- [ ] All features from your PRD are visually represented
- [ ] Mobile and desktop versions work properly
- [ ] Colors and typography match your vision
- [ ] All user flows from PRD can be followed in the design

**✅ DELIVERABLE**: Save the Bolt.new project URL (bookmark it). You'll load this project in Phase 3 for development.

### Phase 3: Development

**Objective**: Transform your wireframes into a fully functional application using your PRD specifications.

**What You'll Use**: 
- Your PRD document from Phase 1 (keep it open)
- Your Bolt.new wireframe project from Phase 2

**Step-by-Step Process**:

#### 3.1 Continue in Same Bolt.new Project (Recommended)
1. **Open your existing Bolt.new project** from Phase 2 (use the bookmark/URL you saved)
2. **Keep your PRD document open** in another tab for reference
3. **Continue in the same chat** - don't start a new project

**Why continue in same project?**
- Your wireframes are already loaded and context is maintained
- Faster development since AI remembers your design decisions
- No need to re-explain your requirements

#### 3.2 Alternative: Create New Development Project
**Only if your Phase 2 project has issues or you want a fresh start:**

1. **Export your wireframes**: In Phase 2 project, copy all the HTML/CSS code
2. **Start new Bolt.new project**
3. **Paste wireframes first**, then add this context prompt:

```
I have wireframes from a previous project that I need to make functional. Here are my wireframes:

[PASTE THE HTML/CSS CODE FROM PHASE 2 PROJECT]

This design was created based on my PRD:
[PASTE YOUR COMPLETE PRD FROM PHASE 1]

Now I need to add full functionality to these wireframes.
```

#### 3.3 Add Functionality to Your Wireframes
**Use this development prompt in your chosen project:**

```
Transform these wireframes into a fully functional application using my PRD specifications.
